# Reference web application

This is a reference web application. It's purpose is to demonstrate an architecture (focusing, at least for now, on the backend) for a medium complexity web application developed by a very small team (about 3 developers). The architecture that this project is demonstrating is a Domain Driven Design Modular Monolith that uses a thin application layer to orchestrate cross-aggregate operations.

The goal is to keep the application simple enough to be easy to understand, while still solving (demonstrating how to solve) a variety of problems typical of a medium complexity web application. For example: it includes solutions for:

1. Domain Driven Design Modular Monolith using Hexogonal architecture
1. Cross-aggregate operations
1. More to follow...
